# Car Finder

## How it Works

- Step 1: user_parameters are set in their python module
- Step 2: Car information is retrieved in get_car_info
- Step 3: The information is scraped from the web in scraper_app
- Step 4: The info is then parsed out and appended to list of cars in the same module
- Step 5: The values parsed for each of the cars are then compared to the user parameters set in the first step
