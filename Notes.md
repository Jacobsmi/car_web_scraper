# Notes

## Working On

- Getting user parameters for how much they are willing to pay, range for year, mileage, etc

## To-Do

- Instead of having things in the main should create an app that calls the scraper, parser, etc
- Add the ability to search by year on the webpage(This could already be parsed out)
- Add the ability to send an email if a car is found within a certain criteria

## Could Do

- Store results of search in a database
- Search the Select object for available options when having a user input the Make and Model in order to validate
